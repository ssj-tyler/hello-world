# hello-world
My first repository with everyone's favorite first coding tutorial

I am a musician, an athlete, and an aspiring data scientist/analyst. With the latter I have been studying these fields through Codecademy and have learned to really love the process of examining data to find hidden insights and truths. I chose this path because when I tried to teach myself to code in the past I couldn't think of what I wanted to create or solve as a software engineer, and I <b>really</b> didn't enjoy coding in Javascript as a web developer (I've heard it's gotten better over time so maybe I'll look into it again...). I'm happy with the path that I've chosen, as I enjoy the prospect of understanding and manipulating data to understand the present and to predict the future, and I'll stop at nothing to build up my skillsets and portfolio until it lands me within this industry.
